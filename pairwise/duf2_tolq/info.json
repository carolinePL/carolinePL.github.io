    "description":"Pairwise comparison of the class1 catalytic domains from the DUF2 (<a href='/class1/DUF2'>DUF2</a>) and tolQ (<a href='/class1/tolQ'>tolQ</a>) families. \n\tThe cross-family RMSD is the average RMSD between pairs of structures from different families, and is\n\t larger than the total RMSD, which compares structures both within- and between-families. TM scores are bound between 0 and 1. \n\t This alignment was generated automatically using 3DCOMB (Wang et al. 2011) and was not corrected with any manual adjustment.",
