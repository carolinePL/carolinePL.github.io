Pairwise comparison of the class1 catalytic domains from the DUF3450 (<a href='/class1/DUF3450'>DUF3450</a>) and tolQ (<a href='/class1/tolQ'>tolQ</a>) families. 
	The cross-family RMSD is the average RMSD between pairs of structures from different families, and is
	 larger than the total RMSD, which compares structures both within- and between-families. TM scores are bound between 0 and 1. 
	 This alignment was generated automatically using 3DCOMB (Wang et al. 2011) and was not corrected with any manual adjustment.
